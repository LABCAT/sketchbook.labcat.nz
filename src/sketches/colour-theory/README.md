# Colour Theory Sketches

A series of interactive generative art sketches exploring the intersection of colour theory and sacred geometry. Born from a love of colour and inspired by the [CodePen Challenge: The Color Wheel](https://codepen.io/challenges/2025/september) for September 2025.

## Sketch 1 - Complementary Colours

This project is an exploration of complementary colours and sacred geometry. I've always been drawn to sacred geometry - the mathematical beauty and spiritual significance of these ancient patterns. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to combine my passion for colour with these timeless geometric forms.

The interactive elements mean each interaction is a unique moment of discovery - a chance to see how different geometric forms interact with complementary colour schemes.

### Technical Exploration

This sketch also serves as my first exploration of the [p5.Polar library](https://github.com/liz-peng/p5.Polar) - a fascinating extension that brings polar coordinate systems to p5.js, making it much easier to create the radial patterns that are so central to sacred geometry.

## Sketch 2 - Blending Colours

Building on the foundation of Sketch 1, this exploration delves deeper into color theory by experimenting with p5.js's blendMode function. While the first sketch focused on complementary colors, this iteration examines how different blending techniques can create entirely new visual experiences with the same sacred geometry patterns.

Some blend modes like REPLACE and REMOVE didn't produce satisfying visual results, so they were removed from the final implementation. This process of experimentation and refinement led to a curated selection of 8 blend modes that each offer unique and compelling interactions with the geometric forms.

### Key Differences from Sketch 1

The most significant structural change is the move from a responsive 2-cell layout to a fixed 4-quadrant layout. This creates a more complex visual field with alternating background colors that better showcases how different blend modes also interact witha black or white background.

### Technical Exploration

This sketch serves as an exploration of p5.js's blendMode capabilities, demonstrating how the same geometric patterns can produce dramatically different results depending on the blending technique applied.
