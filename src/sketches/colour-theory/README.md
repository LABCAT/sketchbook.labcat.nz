# Colour Theory Sketches

A series of interactive generative art sketches exploring the intersection of colour theory and sacred geometry. Born from a love of colour and inspired by the [CodePen Challenge: The Color Wheel](https://codepen.io/challenges/2025/september) for September 2025.

## Sketch 1 - Complementary Colours

This project is an exploration of complementary colours and sacred geometry. I've always been drawn to sacred geometry - the mathematical beauty and spiritual significance of these ancient patterns. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to combine my passion for colour with these timeless geometric forms.

The interactive elements mean each interaction is a unique moment of discovery - a chance to see how different geometric forms interact with complementary colour schemes.

### Technical Exploration

This sketch also serves as my first exploration of the [p5.Polar library](https://github.com/liz-peng/p5.Polar) - a fascinating extension that brings polar coordinate systems to p5.js, making it much easier to create the radial patterns that are so central to sacred geometry.
